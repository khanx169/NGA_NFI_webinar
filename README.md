# Hands-on Introduction to Deep Learning and Computer Vision

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khanx169/hal_tutorial/)

__Revamped version of my [Intro. to Deep Learning Tutorial](https://github.com/khanx169/hal_tutorial) for the New Frontiers Initiative Webinar Series. More info at: https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/NFI/Webinars/DeepLearning __

This tutorial covers the basics of Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Nets. The tutorial is broken into four notebooks. The topics covered in each notebook are:

1. **Intro.ipynb**: 

      - *Linear Regression* as _single layer, single neuron model_ to motivate the introduction of Neural Networks as Universal Approximators that are modeled as collections of neurons connected in an acyclic graph
      - _Convolutions_ and examples of simple _image filters_ to motivate the construction of _Convolutionlal Neural Networks._
      - Loss/Error functions, Gradient Decent, Backpropagation, etc

2. **Mnist.ipynb**: 

    - Visualizing Data
    - Constructing simple Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Training and Inference
    - Visualizing/Interpreting trained Neural Nets

3. **CIFAR-10.ipynb**: 

    - Data Generators
    - Overfitting
    - Data Augmentation
    
4. **Image_Segmentation.ipynb**
    - Semantic Segmentation
    - UNet

The code examples presented here are mostly taken (verbatim) or inspired from the following sources. I made this curation to give a quick exposure to very basic but essential ideas/practices in deep learning to get you started fairly quickly, but I recommend going to some or all of the actual sources for an in depth survey:
